Current Algorithm Status:

	- The mouse misses the finish cell on turns. For example, if the finish point comes after a left 
	turn, the mouse turns but doesn't read the zero (0) on the cell, it keeps moving forward. 
	The problem might be in the scanWalls() function or the calibrate() function.
	I'm currently using the wireless debugging method on my Android phone to pinpoint the error.
