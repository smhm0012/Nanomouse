### Database
----------
Collects the mouse maze path and stores it in a table. It then sends it to the EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) 
a memory whose values are kept when the board is turned off (like a tiny hard drive) integrated on the Arduino board, 
then it displays it on a window to see the results.   
 	
 	
My Database Status:

	- The Database is working but it is not reading and displaying any maze position value from the EEPROM

Recommended IDE: 

	- Arduino and the Arduino software to create your database
